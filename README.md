# Modified environment to train a DeepRacer model locally on different tracks with modified textures

This setup is based on the Deepracer-for-Dummies community version of Local Training. The base idea is to randomly switch the textures of different tracks and evalue the model on the unseen re:Invent 2018 and re:Invent 2019 tracks to test the sim-2-real performance.
